## Partials

Partials start with an "_". e.g. \_navbar.html.erb. These are similar to components, as they will be used many times throughout the system.

`<%= render 'navbar' %>` The "_" is not necessary, rails already knows that this file is a partial.

- `rails c` - Open the rails console.
- `rails routes` - Inspect what routes are mapped.
